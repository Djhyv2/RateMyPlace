README5
	Our technical documentation has not changed since Demo 1 as we included the full scope of our project in the documentation, even though all of the functionality was not done. Since Demo 1, we have completed all of the functionality that is discussed in the technical documentation.

	Our user documentation has been greatly expanded to include details and screenshots of the features finished since Demo 1. This includes viewing a complex, comparing reviews, editing reviews, and deleting reviews.

	Our brochure has not changed since Demo 1. We created it with the assumption that all our functionality would be finished, and it has been. Thus, our brochure includes all functionality finished for Demo 2. 

	Our slides have not been altered since Demo 1. They are included here due to the requirements stating they should be, but since they were not used in Demo 2, they were not updated. If the slides were needed to be used, they would need to be updated to include functionality such as viewing complexes, comparing reviews, and editing reviews.

	Our individual contributions have not changed since Demo 1. All members have contributed equally.
