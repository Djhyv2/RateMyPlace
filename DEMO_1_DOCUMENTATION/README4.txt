All data collection is done manually from within the system as the main goal of the Add Review use case. More detailed instructions are located in our user documentation, but the simple explanation is that users will select the Add Review option from the navigation bar, fill out the displayed form as prompted, and click on the Submit Review button. There is no large scale or automated method for data collection in this system. All data currently existing in the system was manually loaded by group members to facilitate the testing of the system.
